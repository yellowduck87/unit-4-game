# Quack Collector (aka crystal collector)

This game is a puzzle game witha simple random number mechanic. 

Each duck image is assigned a random number between 1 and 12, and these asssignments are then used to play the game, which is trying to add up clicks to a target number. It is very similar to the card game Black Jack, except the game pieces can be used multiple times in order to reach the desired goal. 

Once the disired number is either reached or exceeded, a win or a loss is taliied respectivly, and the game resets to play again.
